<h3>Federated Learning Utility frameworK for Experimentation and research.</h3>
<h4>Made by researchers for researchers!</h4>

**``fluke``** is a benchmarking tool for Federated Learning (FL). It is designed to be
flexible, easy to use, and easy to extend, and can be used to benchmark a wide variety of
federated learning algorithms. **``fluke``** is meant for researchers and practitioners who
want to quickly develop their own federated algorithm and test its performance against
state-of-the-art algorithms on a variety of datasets and conditions. In **``fluke``** **the federation
is simulated**.

## Philosophy

**``fluke``** is designed to minimize the development overhead of adding new algorithms and performing
experiments. It is built on the following principles:

- **Easy to use**: **``fluke``** is designed to be easy to use. It is easy to install, to run, and to
configure. Running a federated learning experiment is as simple as running a single command. 
- **Easy to extend**: **``fluke``** is designed to be easy to extend minimazing the overhead of adding
new algorithms. Adding a new method is as simple as adding the definition of the client and the server.
- **Up-to-date**: **``fluke``** implements state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms and datasets
and is regularly updated to include the latest affirmed techniques.
- **Simulated**: in **``fluke``** the federation is simulated. This means that the communication between
the clients and the server is happens in a simulated channel and the data is not actually sent over 
the network. The simulated environment frees the user from aspects not related to the algorithm itself.
