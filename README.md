# **fluke**: **f**ederated **l**earning **u**tility framewor**k** for **e**xperimentation and research

``fluke`` is a Python package that provides a framework for federated learning research. It is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing researchers to easily implement and test new federated learning algorithms. ``fluke`` provides a set of pre-implemented state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms that can be used as a starting point for research or as a benchmark for comparison.

## Installation

### Pypi

``fluke`` is a Python package that can be installed via pip. To install it, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install fluke-fl
```

### üê≥ Docker

You can use this library directly inside a Docker container ‚Äî no installation needed on your local machine.

```bash
docker build -t fluke_container .
```

Then, you can run an interactive session with

```bash
docker run --rm fluke_container fluke [ARGS]
```

where `ARGS` are the arguments you want to pass to the `fluke` command as described in the next section.

## Run a federated algorithm

To run an algorithm in ``fluke`` you need to create two configuration files:
- `EXP_CONFIG`: the experiment configuration file (independent from the algorithm);
- `ALG_CONFIG`: the algorithm configuration file;

Then, you can run the following command:

```bash
fluke federation EXP_CONFIG ALG_CONFIG
```

You can find some examples of these files in the [configs](https://github.com/makgyver/fluke/tree/main/configs) folder of the repository.

### Example
Let say you want to run the classic `FedAvg` algorithm on the `MNIST` dataset. Then, using the configuration files [exp.yaml](https://github.com/makgyver/fluke/blob/main/configs/exp.yaml) and [fedavg.yaml](https://github.com/makgyver/fluke/blob/main/configs/fedavg.yaml), you can run the following command:

```bash
fluke federation path_to_folder/exp.yaml path_to_folder/fedavg.yaml
```

where `path_to_folder` is the path to the folder containing the configuration files.
