class Server(ObserverSubject):
    """Basic Server for Federated Learning.
    This class is the base class for all servers in ``fluke``. It implements the basic
    functionalities of a federated learning server. The default behaviour of this server is based
    on the Federated Averaging algorithm. The server is responsible for coordinating the learning
    process, selecting the clients for each round, sending the global model to the clients, and
    aggregating the models received from the clients at the end of the round. The server also
    evaluates the model server-side (if the test data is provided).

    Attributes:
        hyper_params (DDict):
          The hyper-parameters of the server. The default hyper-parameters are:

          - weighted: A boolean indicating if the clients should be weighted by the number of
            samples when aggregating the models.

          When a new server class inherits from this class, it must add all its hyper-parameters
          to this dictionary.
        device (torch.device): The device where the server runs.
        model (torch.nn.Module): The federated model to be trained.
        clients (Iterable[Client]): The clients that will participate in the federated learning
          process.
        rounds (int): The number of rounds that have been executed.
        test_set (FastDataLoader): The test data to evaluate the model. If None, the model
          will not be evaluated server-side.
        evaluator (Evaluator): The evaluator to compute the evaluation metrics.

    Args:
        model (torch.nn.Module): The federated model to be trained.
        test_set (FastDataLoader): The test data to evaluate the model.
        clients (Iterable[Client]): The clients that will participate in the federated learning
          process.
        evaluator (Evaluator): The evaluator to compute the evaluation metrics.
        eval_every (int): The number of rounds between evaluations. Defaults to 1.
        weighted (bool): A boolean indicating if the clients should be weighted by the
          number of samples when aggregating the models. Defaults to False.
